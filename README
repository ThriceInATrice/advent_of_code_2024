Grace's Advent of Code 2024
https://adventofcode.com/

Advent of Code is a christmas themed coding event that releases a new programming challenge every day of december until christmas, like an advent calendar. Each day has two parts, the second unlocked when you complete the first. Thus there are two gold stars avilable every day.
Each problem features a small part of the story of saving christmas, then a programming problem with a simple example that you could compute by hand. The you are provided with a much larger input unique to each user and asked for the solution

I've made attempts to follow these challenges in the past, but since doing my coding bootcamp I have a few bit more skill and knowledge to bring to bear. I will be updating this repo with my attempts while I look for programming work.
Each day has its own folder, featuring a python file to solve to problem and an accomanying test file written in tandem. The solution begins with a copy of the explanation of the problem from the advent of code website, and each function in the soltuion has doc strings to explain what it does and how.

This repo currently only requires you to install pytest, but I have included it on a requirements.txt
